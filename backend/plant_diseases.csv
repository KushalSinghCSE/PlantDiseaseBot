Planting materials: Use only healthy and disease free cuttings for planting. Resistant cultivars: Plant cassava varieties that are more tolerant of brown streak virus such as Garukunsubire and Seruruseke. Roguing and sanitation: Remove and destroy any plants which are symptomatic of the disease including alternative hosts. Early Harvesting of tubers: Harvest crop early to avoid severe losses due to necrosis of tubers. Follow proper plant quarantine practices to avoid spread of virus to new region. Control insect vector: Whiteflies can be controlled by encouraging beneficial insects in the field like spiders, ladybird beetles etc. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor infestation of whiteflies.

Coffee,Coffee Rust Leaf,,,,"Resistant varieties Commercially grown coffee has, through the practice of monocultures, lost much of the genetic diversity of its wild ancestors. Sadly, due to the effects of deforestation, wild coffee has also lost much of its genetic diversity outside of its evolutionary center in Ethiopia. The breeding of crop varieties which are resistant to key pathogens has proven to be a very successful method of controlling diseases and inIn the late 1950s, a natural coffee hybrid was discovered growing wild in East Timor. The plant was found to be a hybrid of C. arabica and  C. canephora and was named Hibrído de Timor (HDT). The plant was found to possess full or partial resistance to all known races of the rust pathogen and five genes were subsequently elucidated from the hybrid and from other coffee varieties that were responsible for conferring the resistance  Varieties expressing some of these genes have been grown commercially but the the resistance was broken-down after a few years when new virulent races of the rust pathogen emerged. Crosses of the hybrid with other commercial cultivars produced the ‘Colombia’ cultivar which is now widely planted.  Colombia managed to reduce its losses during the 2012/13 epidemic because of new plantings. Many Colombian farmers are now replanting with Castillo or Colombia varieties. Fungicides Copper-containing fungicides Copper-containing fungicides remain one of the most effective and economical methods of controlling the rust pathogen in susceptible coffee varieties and during conditions which are favorable to the development of rust. They have the added advantage of being active against a number of other fungal pathogens and have also been shown to increase coffee yields. Examples of copper-containg fungicides used in coffee include copper oxychloride and cuprous oxide which have largely replaced the use of Bordeaux mixture in most commercial plantations. These chemicals are applied protectively with plants being sprayed in advance of infection and work by adhering to the plant and producing a toxic barrier to invading fungal pathogens. They pose limitations due to their need to be reapplied at regular intervals to protect new growth flushes and also pose environmental concerns over the accumulation of copper to toxic levels in the soil. Copper-containing fungicides can be alternated with systemic fungicides to reduce the amount of copper build-up. Systemic fungicides Systemic fungicides used in coffee include pyracarbolids such as triadimefon and propiconazole and strobilurins such as azoxystrobin. Systemic fungicides are transported around the plant in the vascular tissue after application thus requiring lower doses and less frequent application than copper-based fungicides. They can be applied after infection has occurred to treat the symptoms of the disease and eradicate it from the host plant. Systemic fungicides tend to be more expensive and some have been shown to induce severe defoliation of the coffee plant. They have been shown to be very effective at controlling rust when used in combination with copper-containing fungicides. Organic fungicides Only one organic fungicide is widely used in coffee - triadimefon. Triadimefon is a systemic fungicide which is applied to the foliage and works to inhibit the rust infection. It can be alternated or combined with other chemicals and is generally very effective at controlling rust infections. Organically certified control methods Most commercially grown coffee varieties are susceptible to coffee rust fungus and because organic farmers cannot use chemical approaches controlling the rust is extremely hard. (note that in some growing regions copper based fungicides are allowed). Here we discuss a few methods and we encourage others to share knowledge by emailing PlantVillage  or answering questions on the forum. i) Planting spore traps. The fungal spore has a rough side that attaches to plant tissue. Wind-break trees can be used to reduce the spore load. Organic coffee is often grown using shade trees which may act to reduce inoculum reaching the coffee plants. ii) Spraying organic formulations that impacts the ability of the spore to germinate or of new spores to be produced.  We have heard that some farmers had success with this strategy but we do not know the details. Dr  Peter Baker of CABI has reported to us that some farmers are using lime sulphur because of the expense of copper. We will try and find more information. Please contact PlantVillage if you have information. iii) Spraying water. It is feasible that high pressure water can wash the spores from the leaves  and reduce the spore load. Heavy rains may also have the same effect. As humidity on the leaves actually promotes fungal growth then washing is best done when the water is likely to evaporate. Biological control Concepts Biological control is the use of one living organism to control another living organism that is considered a pest species. In addition to breeding new and better genetic material and the use of good crop husbandry, the development of an effective biological control strategy could provide another tool to manage coffee rust which would allow for organic certification and the continued use of heirloom varieties. If a suitable agent(s) can be identified in the short term, then this approach would be available in significantly less time than that needed to develop a new variety. CBC of fungi exploits the ability of coevolved fungal natural enemies in order to produce massive quantities of inoculum on the host plant and allow them to spread and propagate continuously within the host population. It offers a sustainable control method but has and has, surprisingly, never been used for crop pathogens (diseases). The concept is simple and follows the enemy-release hypothesis whereby an exotic or alien species increases its fitness, and hence its invasiveness, because it arrives without its guild of co-evolved natural enemies. Examples i) Bacteria Bacteria such as Bacillus and Pseudomonas are known to produce compounds that negatively affect fungal pathogens of plants. Such bacteria evolved in the soil and utilize antifungal compounds to compete with soil dwelling fungi. A number of studies have shown how coffee rust development in greenhouse settings or in the lab can be retarded by Bacillus and Pseudomonas. For example, a study by Haddad et al, 2009 showed for the first time that certain strains of< i>Bacillus and Pseudomonas reduced coffee rust on organic farms in Brazil. In follow up work the same team (Haddad et al 2014) found 17 different bacterial isolates collected from leaves, leaf debris, and soil reduced both the infection frequency and the number of H. vastatrix urediniospores produced per leaf by more than 70%. ii) Other fungi White halo fungus, Lecanicillium lecanii, has been suggested as a potential biological control agent of coffee rust by Prof. John Vandermeer and collaborators at the University of Michigan (Vandermeer et al 2009). White halo fungus has been shown to be hyperparasitic on Hemileia vastatrix in laboratory conditions and it has also been observed attacking the fungus in the field. White halo fungus often infects green coffee scale which feed on coffee. These insects are frequently tended by ants which collect the sugar that they excrete. The ants often create clusters of scale insects on the plants which are infected with white halo disease. It is postulated that white halo fungus may attack and kill the coffee leaf rust fungus or may simply reduce its abundance due to crowding effects or produce chemicals to attack it. Currently, the fungus does not appear be a viable biological control agent because it has not evolved to parasitize the fungi, rather it evolved to infect insects. Promising attempts have  been made to culture the fungus and apply it as a topical spray to control the rust fungus. Future prospects Currently, no CBC program has focused explicitly on controlling coffee rust but pathogenic rusts have themselves been used to control other pests. For example, rubber vine is considered to be a major pest plant in Australia as it is highly invasive and causes millions of dollars of damage to agriculture and massive ecological damage. A team led by Dr. Harry Evans, a scientific officer with CAB International, identified a rust called Maravalia (which is taxonomically close to coffee rust) in the center of genetic origin for rubber vine in Madagascar which showed potential for use as a CBC agent. Before the rust could be released in the environment in Australia, it had to be quarantined. This process removed the rust from its natural enemies and had the effect of making the rust fungus extremely pathogenic. Dr. Evan’s stated that the rust went ‘berserk’ and when it was eventually deployed in Australia, it was extremely successful at controlling the rubber vine, even killing off young seedlings. In 2014, another team led by Dr. Evans and Dr. Roberto Barretto of the Federal University of Vicosa in Brazil will begin to explore genetic centers of origin of Arabica coffee with the aim of identifying similar co-evolved natural enemies of Hemileia vastatrix. It is believed that CBC holds great promise for the future control of coffee rust."

Origins and spread
Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a “yellow shoot” disease of citrus while evaluating  diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx  by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of “huang long bing”, which translates to “yellow dragon disease”, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees. By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - “greening” in South Africa, “mottle leaf” in the Philippines, “dieback” in India and “vein phloem degeneration” in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia.      

Biology and ecology
The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant. The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L. africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L. asiaticus, found in .A third species, L. americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements. As this species is found in the same areas as L. asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements.    

Transmission
Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae  is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius,

Citrus psyllids
Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew. Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed. They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers. When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days. In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments. 

Grafting
Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956. The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.","Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. (ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids."

Origins and spread
Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a “yellow shoot” disease of citrus while evaluating diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of “huang long bing”, which translates to “yellow dragon disease”, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees. By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - “greening” in South Africa, “mottle leaf” in the Philippines, “dieback” in India and “vein phloem degeneration” in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. 

Biology and ecology
The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant. The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L. africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L. asiaticus, found in .A third species, L. americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements. As this species is found in the same areas as L. asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements. 

Transmission
Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius,

Citrus psyllids
Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew. Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed. They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers. When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days. In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments. 

Grafting
Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956. The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.","Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. (ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids."

Origins and spread
Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a “yellow shoot” disease of citrus while evaluating diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of “huang long bing”, which translates to “yellow dragon disease”, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees. By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - “greening” in South Africa, “mottle leaf” in the Philippines, “dieback” in India and “vein phloem degeneration” in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. 

Biology and ecology
The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant. The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L. africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L. asiaticus, found in .A third species, L. americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements. As this species is found in the same areas as L. asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements. 

Transmission
Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius,

Citrus psyllids
Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew. Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed. They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers. When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days. In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments. 

Grafting
Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956. The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.","Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. (ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids."

Maize (corn),Bacterial stalk rot/soft rot,"Plants suddenly beginning to lodge (bend to lie along the ground) midway through season; one or more internodes above soil line turning brown, water-soaked, soft and slimy; tissue has foul odor and mushy appearance;",Bacterium,Disease is most commonly found in plantations which have overhead irrigation systems or in areas with high rainfall; disease emergence is favored by high temperatures and high humidity.,Plow all crop debris into soil in Fall; plant corn in well-draining soil to prevent waterlogged plants.
Maize (corn),Goss's bacterial blight,Gray or yellow stripes with irregular margins on leaf surfaces; stripes follow leaf veins and contain characteristic dark green to black water-soaked spots; if infection occurs early then plant may become wilted or withered; it is common to find a crystalline residue on leaves caused by dried bacterial exudate.,Bacteria,"Disease overwinters in diseased crop debris on, or close to, the soil surface; temperatures below 12°C (53.6°F) and above 40°C (104°F) bacterium grows more slowly and may even be killed off.",Plant resistant sweetcorn hybrids; rotate crop; plow crop debris into soil immediately after harvest.
Maize (corn),Holcus spot,Circular or elliptical spots 2-10 mm across near the tips of lower leaves which are dark green and water soaked initially but become cream to tan before turning dry and brown; lesions may have red-brown margins; large lesions may have a yellow halo.,Bacterium,Disease can occur anywhere where corn is grown but is not usually very damaging.,Disease is usually not severe but if it does become a problem crops should be rotated and any debris should be plowed into the soil after harvest.
Maize (corn),Stewart’s wilt,"The main symptoms are appearance of water soaked lesions initially. As the disease progress the lesions become long and turn pale yellow with irregular margins running in the length. The pathogen may infect the stem and causes stunting, wilting and death of plant.",Bacterium,The pathogen is mainly transmitted by maize flea beetles and to lesser extent by infected seeds.,Grow available resistant varieties. Use certified healthy seeds. Remove the crop debris and burn them. Use suitable insecticide to control flea beetle.
Maize (corn),Fall armyworm - IPM,,,,Many commercial corn hybrids are highly tolerant of the disease and no control is needed; control aphid populations on plants and remove any Johnson grass growing in the vicinity as it can act as a reservoir for the virus.
Maize (corn),Fall armyworm Open Access Knowledge,,,,"Use healthy, disease free certified seeds. Keep the fields free from weeds. Remove the infected plants and burn them. Control vectors by treating seed and/ foliar spray with suitable insecticide. Follow crop rotation with non cereals at least for two seasons. Plant maize only in main rainy season instead of short rainy season. Grow available resistant varieties."
Maize (corn),Fall armyworm Pesticides,,,,Control of the disease relies on improving soil drainage or planting corn in areas where the soil is well-draining; systemic fungicides can be used to treat seed prior to planting to protect seedlings from disease.
Maize (corn),Fall armyworm Remote sensing,,https://plantvillage.psu.edu/diseases/fall-armyworm_remote-sensing,,"Practice good garden sanitation by removing garden trash, weeds and plant debris to promote good air circulation and reduce moist habitat for slugs and snails; handpick slugs at night to decrease population; spread wood ashes or eggshells around plants; attract molluscs by leaving out organic matter such as lettuce or grapefruit skins, destroy any found feeding on lure; sink shallow dishes filled with beer into the soil to attract and drown the molluscs; chemical controls include ferrous phosphate for organic gardens and metaldehyde (e.g. Buggeta) and carbaryl (e.g Sevin bait) for non-organic growers."
Maize (corn),Maize dwarf mosaic,Chlorotic spots and streaks on leaves which develop into a mottled or mosaic pattern; susceptible plants may be stunted; ear formation and development cease; mosaic and mottling with no red discoloration are characteristic symptoms of the disease.,Virus,Virus is transmitted by more than 15 different species of aphid and is passed to the plant from the insect in seconds to minutes of feeding; sorghum is also a major host of the virus.,It is rare for aphids to reach levels that are damaging to the plant and no control is generally warranted as insecticide sprays will not prevent transmission of viruses.
Maize (corn),Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) or Corn Lethal Necrosis (CLN),"The disease occurs at all stages of crop. The main symptoms includes appearance of chlorotic mottling on leaves which starts from base and extends upwards. Also the leaves shows necrosis at margins which later extends to mid rib and results in drying of entire leaf. The necrosis of young leaves in the whorl causes dead heart symptom. Other symptoms are premature plant death, shortened male inflorescences with few spikes, and/or shortened, malformed, partially filled ears.",Virus,"The virus mainly spread by vectors (maize thrips, aphids, rootworms and leaf beetles) and infected seeds. The first report of this disease in Africa continent was in Kenya (2011). And later the disease spreads to other countries like Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan.",Corn earworms are most problematic on sweet corn varieties and treatment should be applied at egg hatch; monitor plants for eggs and young larvae and also natural enemies that could be damaged by chemicals; Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC may be applied to control insects on organically grown plants; appropriate chemical treatment may be required for control in commercial plantations.

Maize (corn),"Aphids (Corn leaf aphid, Peach Aphid)","Heavy infestations can result in curled leaves and stunted plants; honeydew secretions promote growth of sooty mold; corn leaf aphids are blue-green in color, peach aphids are green-yellow in color; aphids may transmit viruses when feeding.",Insects,Grassy weeds also serve as hosts for corn-leaf aphids; peach aphids have a wide host range.,"In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied."
Maize (corn),Corn earworm,"Feeding damage to leaves, tassel and leaf whorls; preferred feeding site is the ear and insect produces extensive excrement at the tip of the ear; younger larvae feed on silks, severing them from the plant; young caterpillars are cream-white in color with a black head and black hairs; older larvae may be yellow-green to almost black in color with fine white lines along their body and black spots at the base of hairs; eggs are laid singly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and are initially creamy white but develop a brown-red ring after 24 hours and darken prior to hatching.",Insect,"Adult insect is a pale green to tan, medium sized moth; can be a very damaging pests ofcorn; insect overwinters as pupae in the soil.","Avoid planting next to onions, garlic where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic; young plants will recover from damage and treatment is not often necessary as the thrips are beneficial for controlling mites."
Maize (corn),"Cutworms (Black cutworm, Variegated cutworm)","Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed.",Insects,"Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato.",Deep summer ploughing helps in reducing nematode population. Follow crop rotation with nematode antagonistic plants. Grow resistant varieties. In severely infected field follow soil fumigation with suitable nematicide.
Maize (corn),Fall Armyworm,"Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside.
1. Leaf damage is usually characterized by ragged feeding, and moist sawdust-like frass near the funnels and upper leaves of the plant.
2. Leaf damage is usually scattered in rows across the leaf
3. Younger larvae usually eat tissue from one side, leaving the other side in tact. This is what creates windows in the leaf
4. Deep feeding may may destroy maize tassels.
5. Caterpillars enter through the side of the ear and feed on developing kernels",Insects,Insect can go through 3–5 generations a year.,"In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction."

Collect the fallen fruits and destroy them. 2. Also harvest fruits early to reduce flies damage . 3. Use traps to monitor fruit flies. Traps can be purchased in the market or one can prepare themselves. Take plastic container with lids (one quarts yogurt container is fine). Drill holes (10 to 16 holes) that are 3/16-inch in diameter around the upper side of the container. Add 1 to 2 inch of pure apple cider vinegar (not flavored one) and a drop of unscented liquid dishwashing soap into the container. Hang the container in shade near berry trees before fruits ripening and check the traps frequently for flies. Change the vinegar every week. 5. Spraying protein bait under leaf surface attract flies to single spot which make easier to kill them. 4. If infestation is severe spray suitable insecticide.
Mango,Fruit fly,"The adult female flies lay egg just under the skin of semi repine fruits. The maggots develop and feed inside the fruit, causing the flesh to turn brown and soft which emits foul smell. This damage also act as entry site for fungal and bacterial pathogens.",Insect,The mature maggots fall out of the fruits and pupate in soil.,"1. Collect and burn fallen leaves and twigs. 2. Flooding orchard with water during October kills egg present in soil. Also deep ploughing in November exposes egg to sunlight. 3. After hatching the nymphs start climbing tree and suck sap. To avoid this band the tree trunks with polythene sheet (400 gauge, 30 cm wide) at a height of about 30 cm from the ground level and apply grease at the lower edge of band. Or you can use Funnel Type Slippery Traps. 4. To control insects already on tree you can spray fish oil rosin soap or azadirachtin (neem products). 5. Also soil application of the spores of the fungus, Beauveria bassiana helps in reducing mealybug population. 6. If infestation is severe you can spray suitable insecticides"
Mango,Mango hoppers,Reduced plant vigor; sticky substance coating leaves; may be a growth of sooty mold on sticky residues; curling and drying leaves,Insects,Insect emergence favored by shady and humid conditions,Application of appropriate insecticide to the trunk and branches of the tree when adult insects are present acts to kill any eggs and larvae that are present; insecticide applied to growing twigs and green shoots may deter adult feeding; probing injury sites with a knife or piece of wire can help to destroy larvae and eggs
Mango,Mango mealybugs,"Both nymphs and female insects sucks sap form all parts mango tree (i.e., tender leaves, shoots and inflorescence). The infected inflorescences may dry up affecting the fruit set and may cause fruit drop. Severely infected plants may show wilting and thereby affect fruit setting.",Insect,"a. Mealybugs lay eggs in soil near tree trunk.

Origins and spread
Huanglongbing, or citrus greening, was first reported from Southern China in 1919 by American botanist Otto August Reinking who described a “yellow shoot” disease of citrus while evaluating diseases of economic plants in Southern China. A subsequent field survey conducted between 1941 and 1955 on citrus plants in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangx by Chinese plant pathologist Lin Kongxiang (Kung Hsiang) determined that that the disease likely originated in Chaozhou county in Guangdong as early as the 1870s. Lin adopted the name the local farmers had given to the disease of “huang long bing”, which translates to “yellow dragon disease”, a reference to the yellow coloration of new shoots on the infected trees. By 1936 Huanglongbing was considered a serious disease of citrus in China and it subsequently spread across Southeast Asia reaching Indonesia in 1948 and Taiwan in 1950 before spreading to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia in the 1950s, 60s and 70s respectively. The disease has been known by various names in different countries - “greening” in South Africa, “mottle leaf” in the Philippines, “dieback” in India and “vein phloem degeneration” in Indonesia - but in 1995 the disease was officially named Huanglongbing by the International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) and this name is now widely used to describe the disease in Africa, America and Asia. 

Biology and ecology
The organism that causes Huanglongbing is a Gram-negative bacterium that is limited to the plant phloem - the plant system responsible for the delivery of sugars from the leaves to the growing parts of the plant. The bacteria involved have so far not been isolated and cultured but the disease is believed to be caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter. It is believed that there are at least two different forms of the disease, an African heat-sensitive form, L. africanus which survives in cool areas with temperatures below 30-32 C, and an Asian heat-tolerant form which occurs in areas where temperatures greatly exceed 30C. A third species, L. asiaticus, found in .A third species, L. americanus was detected in citrus trees in Sao Paulo, Brazil but there is presently little information on its climatic requirements. As this species is found in the same areas as L. asiaticus it seems likely that is has similar requirements. 

Transmission
Huanglongbing can be transmitted by citrus psyllids or by grafting. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is responsible for the spread of the disease in Asia and Oceania, Brazil and North America whereas the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae is the main vector in Africa and Madagascar. Both psyllid species are present the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mauritius,

Citrus psyllids
Citrus psyllids are tiny (3-4 mm) sap-sucking insects that excrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew. Both the Asian and African citrus psyllids are mottled brown in color but the Asian citrus psyllid possesses a brown head and the African species has a black head. Adult citrus psyllids will jump and/or fly for a short distance when they are disturbed. They are usually found on the undersides of leaves, often in high numbers. When a psyllid feeds on an infected plant, it acquires the disease after 15 to 30 minutes and feeding and is able to transmit the disease to new hosts after a period of 21 days. In order to transmit the disease successfully, the psyllids need only feed on a new host for a period of 15 minutes in order for successful transmission to occur. It is hypothesized that the bacterium multiplies within the body of the psyllid prior to transmission but this theory requires validation through experiments. 

Grafting
Although the primary method of spread of the Huanglongbing bacterium is via the movement of citrus psyllids, the disease can also be transmitted through grafting practices. The ability of Huanglongbing to be transmitted by grafting was first demonstrated by Lin Kongxiang through experimental work which was published in 1956. The disease in not transmitted at high rates through grafting as as not all buds on infected trees contain the bacterium.","Control (i) Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. (ii) Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids."

Pearl Millet,Ergot,"Ergot is a disease of pearl millet grain-bearing heads (inflorescences). The first sign of ergot infection in pearl millet is the appearance of viscous creamy-pink exudations, called honeydew on the flowering heads. Subsequently hard brown spiky structures are formed, called sclerotia.",Fungus,"Ergot reduces grain yields and constitutes a health hazard to humans and animals that consume pearl millet products contaminated with the alkaloid-containing sclerotia of the causal fungus. It is a particularly serious disease of pearl millet F1 hybrids.

Biology and Epidemiology: Infection of the individual florets on a pearl millet inflorescence occurs via the stigmas, i.e. the white feathery structures through which the florets are fertilised following pollination. Initial infection is from spores (ascospores) produced from sclerotia in the soil or in crop debris. Secondary infection is from the spores (conidia) produced in the honeydew. Once the stigmas have been pollinated they rapidly wither and are no longer available as the infection route for the ergot fungus. Pearl millet plants are protogynous, with the stigmas emerging before the anthers. Pearl millet F1 hybrids demonstrate synchronous flowering, so that most of the inflorescences in a crop will be at the protogynous stage with little or no pollen available, which makes F1 hybrids particularly vulnerable to ergot infection. Heavy rain at flowering time washes down pollen, extending the period at which the stigmas are available for infection as well as providing ideal conditions for germination and sporulation of the ergot fungus.","Ergot can be managed in pearl millet, through the use of host plant resistance, pollen management, avoidance and sanitation. Host plant resistance to ergot can be developed using appropriate inoculation, hybridisation and selection techniques. Sources of host plant resistance are developed and made available by public- and private-sector seed companies. It has been shown in research station experiments that using pollen donor plants to coincide with the protogynous stage of crop flowering can significantly reduce infection in ergot susceptible pearl millet F1 hybrids. Avoidance of ergot is achieved through the selection of cultivars that flower during periods of fine dry weather, so that pollen wash and pathogen germination are minimised. Sanitation measures involve the removal and burning of infected inflorescences as soon ergot symptoms are seen. When this is done at the honeydew stage it will reduce secondary spread within the crop. When done at the sclerotial stage it will reduce the inoculum bank for infections in subsequent seasons and reduce the dangers of consumption of the the poisonous alkaloids getting into food and feed products."
Pearl Millet,Pearl Millet Downy Mildew,"The earliest symptoms are chlorosis at the base of a leaf, with subsequent leaves on the plant becoming more and more chlorotic, with the chlorosis always extending from the bases towards the tips of the leaves. The underside of chlorotic leaves develop white powdery or downy growth of sporangia and the spores that they bear. There is a distinct margin between diseased leaf tissue at base of leaf and healthy tissue towards tip. Inflorescences of infected tillers develop the characteristic green-ear symptoms where the grain is replaced by whip-like vegetative structures. Inflorescences can be partially or fully converted to green-ear, depending on the time in inflorescence development at which the infection occurred. Partial green-ear always begins at the base of the inflorescence. Plants infected at an early stage of development, before tillering begins can be killed.",Oomycete,"Serious disease in Africa and India, occurs wherever millet is grown.","The disease is systemic with the pathogen infecting the growing point of each tiller as the leaf and panicle tissues are being formed. Primary infection is from oospores which are long-lived in the soil. Secondary infection is from the spores produced by the sporangia on the undersides of infected leaves. Oospores are formed in necrotic infected plant material, which then contribute to the inoculum bank in the soil. To reduce infection rogue infected plants when found in the field; treat seeds with an appropriate systemic fungicide prior to planting and continue to spray the crop at least once every 25 days after sowing. Seed treatment Pearl millet downy mildew can be effectively controlled through the use of metalaxyl-based fungicide seed treatments. Application rates as low as 2 g a.i. per kg seed, using specially formulated seed-treatment products, can provide complete control of downy mildew even with highly susceptible hybrids. There is no value of subsequent foliar fungicide sprays following effective seed treatment. On-farm sanitation and selection In situations where resistant cultivars and seed treatments are not available, farming communities can reduce the incidence of downy mildew in pearl millet by on-farm sanitation practices and the selection of seed from robust downy mildew-free plants. Secondary spread of downy mildew within a crop is caused by the spores produced on diseased leaves, so removal of diseased plants or tillers at the first sign of disease should minimise secondary spread. Removal of diseased plants prior to inflorescence emergence, combined with selection of seed for the next season’s sowing from robust, downy mildew-free plants, should also reduce the level of susceptibility in the local cultivar gene pool developing a population of locally DM-resistant cultivars. Sanitation and selection will be more effective if done on a community basis rather than by individual farmers acting alone. The basis for effective on-farm actions is for farmers to fully understand the cause and epidemiology of the disease. Host Plant Resistance Pearl millet downy mildew is best managed by the use of resistant cultivars. Much has been learnt and done in the last 30 years to identify and utilise host plant resistance to this disease, through research done by ICRISAT in collaboration with National Agricultural Research Services (NARS) in India and other countries. In India, the existence of a strong and effective national agricultural research system together with effective public- and private-sector seed companies, has enabled the development and dissemination of a succession of cultivars and hybrids that have a high degree of resistance to downy mildew. The pathogen, however, is variable in its pathogenicity, so that cultivars or hybrids resistant to downy mildew in one region may not be resistant elsewhere. The greatest range of pathogenicity occurs in the Sahel zone of Africa, where the host and pathogen have co-evolved over a long period. Pearl millet hybrids developed for resistance to downy mildew in India have been highly susceptible when grown in the Sahel. Through the ICRISAT-NARS cooperative International Pearl Millet Downy Mildew Nursery program, sources of resistance have been identified that are effective throughout India and right across the African Sahel."

Pearl Millet,Smut,"Smut is a disease of pearl millet grain-bearing heads (inflorescences) that can significantly reduce grain yields, wherever the crop is grown.
Infected florets develop as plump sacs or sori, initially green in colour and then turning dark brown or black as the sori mature. The sori are filled with black spores of the causal fungus, hence the name smut.",Fungus,"Biology and epidemiology: Individual florets are infected by air-borne spores of the causal fungus when the inflorescences are at the protogynous stage. i.e. when the stigmas have emerged before pollination has occurred. Mature spores released from the sori when the crop is threshed are mixed with seed from non-infected florets, and these are the source of infection for the subsequent crop.",Smut is best managed by the use of resistant cultivars.
Pearl Millet,Striga or Purple Witchweed [Orobanchaceae],"Purple Witchweed is the most serious parasitic weed on pearl millet in Africa, causing severe crop losses to this and other crops in the Sahel region. In India Striga asiatica is the most common witchweed species, though here it is not regarded as a serious problem in pearl millet.",Weed,"Biology & Epidemiology: Seeds of this parasitic plant remain dormant in the soil until exudates from roots of pearl millet plants (and other host species) stimulate their germination. Germ-tubes then invade the pearl millet roots, establishing a pathway for the extraction of moisture and nutrients from the pearl millet plant to enable the witchweed plants to develop and produce a crop of purple flowers. The flowers produce seed which add to the seed bank in the soil for parasitism of future crops.","The most effective management would be achieved by the use of host-plant resistance. In situations where there are no witchweed-resistant cultivars available, farming communities can reduce the levels of damage to the crop by: a) hand-pulling the witchweed plants as soon as they are visible, thereby reducing the loss of nutrients and moisture by the crop plants and preventing the addition of more witchweed seeds to the seed bank in the soil; b) the use of “trap” or “decoy” crops such as cowpea or soybean, possibly as an intercrop, which can stimulate germination of the witchweed seeds but are not parasitised, thus reducing the seed bank available for the pearl millet crop. In addition there are reports of control of witchweed by treating crop seeds with chemicals that prevent the germinating witchweed seeds from parasitising the crop plants. Where such seed treatments have been shown to be effective, are approved for use and are within the economic capabilities of the cultivator, they could be used as part of an integrated management program. Farming communities can also attempt to develop locally-effective resistant varieties by selection of seed from plants that appear to have not been parasitised. A combination of effective locally-available management methods is recommended in an integrated management program."

Tomato,Bacterial spot,Bacterial spot lesions starts out as small water-soaked spots; lesions become more numerous and coalesce to form necrotic areas on the leaves giving them a blighted appearance; of leaves drop from the plant severe defoliation can occur leaving the fruit susceptible to sunscald; mature spots have a greasy appearance and may appear transparent when held up to light; centers of lesions dry up and fall out of the leaf; blighted leaves often remain attached to the plant and give it a blighted appearance; fruit infections start as a slightly raised blister; lesions may have a faint halo which eventually disappears; lesions on fruit may have a raised margin and sunken center which gives the fruit a scabby appearance.,Bacterium,"Bacteria survive on crop debris; disease emergence favored by warm temperatures and wet weather; symptoms are very similar to other tomato diseases but only bacterial spot will cause a cut leaf to ooze bacterial exudate; the disease is spread by infected seed, wind-driven rain, diseased transplants, or infested soil; bacteria enter the plant through any natural openings on the leaves or any openings caused by injury to the leaves.","Use only certified seed and healthy transplants; remove all crop debris from planting area; do not use sprinkler irrigation, instead water from base of plant; rotate crops."
Tomato,Bacterial wilt,"Initial symptoms of the disease is the wilting of a few of the youngest leaves; the disease progresses rapidly in hot weather and the entire plant wilts suddenly and dies; in cooler conditions, wilting is less rapid and plant may produce roots on the stems; vascular tissue shows a brown discoloration and decaying roots; stems cut under water will ooze bacterial exudate and will confirm the symptoms are not caused by Fusarium wilt.",Bacterium,Bacterial wilt can cause complete destruction of the crop under conditions suitable for the spread of the soil-borne bacterium; disease causes serious losses in tomatoes grown in tropical and subtropical regions.,"Cultural practices may help to reduce incidence of the disease, rotate tomato with other, non-susceptible crops; avoid over-watering plants."
Tomato,Blossom-end rot,"Blossom end-rot is caused by a low concentration of calcium in the tomato fruit; symptoms initially appear as light tan, water-soaked areas which can then enlarge and turn black and leathery in appearance; symptoms are most often seen at the blossom end of the fruit, but may also occur on the side of the fruit; blossom-end rot may also occur internally with no visible symptoms on outside of fruit.",Physiological disorder.,"Low calcium may result from competition from other ions in soil e.g. potassium; can also be caused by drought stress; fluctuations in soil moisture or application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer which promotes rapid vegetative growth; calcium cannot be translocated from the leaves to the fruit; foliar applications of Ca materials have not proven to reduce BER, since very little Ca is taken up by the fruit; in greenhouse production not cycling the irrigation system at night can increase BER, since night is an important period of Ca uptake.","Maintain soil pH at 6.5; lime soil to increase the concentration of calcium in soil and decrease competition with other ions; use mulch to reduce drought stress; avoid ammonium fertilizers as they may increase competition with calcium by increasing ammonium ions in soil, use nitrate instead; avoid over fertilizing."
Tomato,Catface,"Catface usually occurs on the blossom end, tomato fruits are usually misshapen with large holes or corky brown scars close to the blossom end of the fruit; fruits are often flattened and may be kidney shaped; holes on the fruit extend deep inside the fruit.",Physiological disorder,"The catface deformity is possibly caused by internal or external changes that occurs during the formation of the flower resulting in the abnormal development of the fruit; the exact cause is unknown, there may be several factors in fruit deformation; cold weather is known to be a factor along with extreme fluctuations in temperatures between day and night; hormone based herbicides may also cause catfacing; varieties that produce large tomatoes are more prone to catfacing.","Avoid pruning tomato plants excessively; avoid excessive fertilization with nitrogen which promotes rapid vegetative growth; if growing tomatoes in a glasshouse, provide the plants with heat to prevent temperatures dropping to damaging levels, particularly at night."
Tomato,Edema (Oedema),Swellings and/or blisters or calluses on leaves caused by rupturing epidermal and inner leaf cells ; deformed foliage which curls; leaf tissue may also tear as the leaf matures; symptoms are often mistaken for disease or insect damage,Physiological disorder,Edema occurs when water is absorbed from the soil faster than it can be transpired through the leaves and is caused by soil being warmer than the surrounding air,"Tomato plants should always be planted in well draining soil or potting media; avoid overwatering tomato plants, particularly during periods of low light and  cool temperatures; if growing tomatoes in a glasshouse then anything that can be done to increase drainage and air circulation will be helpful in preventing edema; reduce humidity in the glasshouse in the morning by venting the house (heat may need to be turned up during this period depending on outdoor temperatures)"
Tomato,Fertilizer burn,Symptoms may first appear as slowed growth and wilting; leaf tips and margins turn brown; plants have a scorched appearance.,Excess nitrogen salts,Fertilizer burn is usually caused by an excess of nitrogen salts in the soil which causes an osmotic stress on the plant tissues. The tissues dry out and die resulting in the characteristic scorched appearance of the leaves.,"Apply appropriate dose of fertilizer for the particular soil in which the plants are growing - nutrient requirements can be ascertained with a soil test; if liquid fertilizer was used, symptoms may be reversed by watering the plants heavily to leach some of the salts from the soil."
Tomato,Little leaf,"Little leaf symptoms include interveinal chlorosis of young leaves, distortion and failure of leaves along the midrib to expand, radial cracks of fruits extending from the calyx to the blossom scar and failure of blooms to set; symptoms progress to increased leaflet distortion and more pronounced interveinal chlorosis.",Physiological disorder,Three conditions appear to pre-dispose plants to little leaf. 1) high soil temperatures 2) high soil moisture and 3) presence of predisposing population of bacterial/fungal microorganisms in the soil.,"Little leaf is usually associated with water-logged areas of fields, subsequent drying out of affected areas usually resolves the problem and subsequent plant growth is normal; controlling the soil pH may also help the problem."
Tomato,Magnesium deficiency,"Symptoms of magnesium deficiency appear on older leaves first; initial symptoms are interveinal chlorosis of the leaves and, occasionally, a purple tinge to the leaves; as the deficiency becomes more severe, leaves may appear white with green veins; severe deficiencies may lead to reduced fruit yield.",Nutritional disorder,Magnesium deficiency is rare in field grown tomatoes but occurs more frequently in soilless tomato culture.,"Magnesium deficiency can be prevented in tomato by applying dolomite lime to the soil, if an increase in soil pH is required, or through applications of a fertilizer containing magnesium."
Tomato,Multiple nutrients deficiency,,Nutritional disorder,,"If detected early, symptoms of nitrogen deficiency can be treated by applying appropriate amounts of nitrogen fertilizer."
Tomato,Nitrogen deficiency,Affected plants are smaller in size and grow less vigorously than healthy plants; symptoms appear on older leaves first; tomato leaves exhibit a general yellowing occasionally accompanied by purple leaf veins; plants possess thinner stems and fruit is smaller than healthy plants; fruits may be misshapen with a lighter red color than healthy plants.,Nutritional disorder,Nitrogen deficiency usually arises in tomato plantations through inadequate fertilizer application; heavy rain can leach nitrogen from sandy soils.,Soil levels of phosphorous should be measured prior to planting to determine the appropriate application for the particular site; phosphorous should be applied to the soil prior to planting if required as applications made after the onset of tomato growth are not usually successful in preventing symptoms.
Tomato,Phosphorous deficiency,"Growth of tomato seedlings is reduced compared with healthy plants; leaves appear darker green and may have a purple tinge; in older tomato plants, leaves grow upright and appear light green on the upper surface and purple on the lower surface; symptoms appear on older leaves first.",Nutritional disorder,Phosphorous deficiency is rare in soils that are already used for agricultural purposes; in field grown tomatoes phosphorous deficiency more commonly appears in newly cleared land which has never been used to grow crops; phosphorus deficiency may occur on soilless tomato cultures if applications of the nutrient are inadequate.,Potassium deficiency can be corrected through applications of the nutrient as a side dressing and/or through an irrigation system.
Tomato,Potassium deficiency,"Affected plants are smaller than healhty plants with smaller fruits and reduced yields; tomato leaves exhibit ""bronzing"", older plant leaves turn tan and then brown at the margins; if deficiency is prolonged, leaves become necrotic at the margins and turn yellow between leaf veins.",Nutritional disorder,"Potassium deficiency is usually caused by an inadequate fertilization, it is more common in sandy soils where the nutrient is easily leached from the soil by heavy rainfall.","Healthy plants with full foliage are less susceptible to sunscald as the leaves provide fruits with shading, ensure plants are watered regularly and fertilized adequately; use shade cloth to protect the fruits from the sun; control diseases that develop to prevent defoliation which can lead to sunscald."
Tomato,Sunscald,Symptoms of sunscald are most common on green fruit; white or yellow necrotic patches develop on the sides of the fruit that are facing the sun; blisters may be white with a yellow halo; damaged areas may become flattened in appearance and papery in texture; damaged areas are often invaded by secondary pathogens and turn black.,Physiological disorder,Sunscald is common on plants which have been moved suddenly from a shaded location to full sun.,Tomato plants should be watered deeply and evenly to avoid water stress; aim to keep the soil moist but not wet; allow the top of the soil to dry before watering again.
Tomato,Water stress,Leaves are green but wilting; leaves roll downwards and eventually drop from the plant; fruits may develop symptoms of Blossom-end rot (See entry).,Physiological stress,It is important to distinguish between plants that are temporarily wilted on hot days and those that are stressed due to lack of moisture in the soil; on very hot days tomato plants will wilt as the rate of transpiration exceeds the rate at which water can be taken up from the soil by the roots and the plants will usually recover in the evening when temperatures are cooler.,"The most effective method of preventing zippering is to grow tolerant varieties; when growing tomatoes in the glasshouse, appropriate temperatures should be maintained."
Tomato,Zippering,Thin brown scars extending longutudinally from the petiole to the blossom-end of the fruit; each scar has smaller scars crossing it tranversely rendering it zipper-like in appearance; holes may open on along the scarred area.,Physiological disorder,Zipper scars on tomato fruit are most prevalent in cool weather.,Cultural control methods such as mulching around the plants and practicing rotation away from tomato can help to reduce losses from the disease; fungicides applied for the control of late blight also help to control the development of buckeye rot; solarizing or fumigating soil can help to reduce levels of inoculum.
Tomato,Buckeye rot (Phytophthora root rot),Buck eye rot of tomato initially appears as a brown spot on the fruit which enlarges over the fruit surface and forms concentric rings; the lesions may eventually cover up to half of the fruit and the flesh develops a soft rot underneath the skin; green or red fruits can be affected and disease often develops where fruit is in contact with the soil; white cottony growth may be visible in the centers of affected regions; spots enlarge and form large concentric ring shaped symptoms which are usually brown in color with sunken edges; the Phytophthora pathogen also causes root rot; young plants may exhibit a white cottony growth at crown of the plant and begin to wilt as the damage to the roots progresses; Phytophthora root rot can cause severe destruction of plant roots and cause the plants to wilt completely.,Fungi,Prolonged period of warm wet conditions favor disease occurrence; heavy soil saturation also favors disease development in soils where pathogen is present; disease can be spread by splashing water.,Plant resistant varieties; if signs of disease are present or if rainy conditions are likely or if using overhead irrigation appropriate fungicides should be applied.
Tomato,Late blight,"Late blight affects all aerial parts of the tomato plant; initial symptoms of the disease appear as water-soaked green to black areas on leaves which rapidly change to brown lesions; fluffy white fungal growth may appear on infected areas and leaf undersides during wet weather; as the disease progresses, foliage becomes becomes shriveled and brown and the entire plant may die; fruit lesions start as irregularly shaped water soaked regions and change to greasy spots; entire fruit may become infected and a white fuzzy growth may appear during wet weather.",Oomycete,Can devastate tomato plantings.,"Plant varieties that are resistant to the virus; heat treating seeds at 70°C (158°F) for 4 days or at 82–85°C (179.6–185°F) for 24 hours will help to eliminate any virus particles on the surface of the seeds; soaking seed for 15 min in 100 g/l of tri-sodium phosphate solution (TSP) can also eliminate virus particles - seeds should be rinsed thoroughly and laid out to dry after this treatment; if the virus is confirmed in the field, infected plants should be removed and destroyed to limit further spread; plant tomato on a 2-year rotation, avoiding susceptible crops such as peppers, eggplant, cucurbits and tobacco; disinfect all equipment when moving from infected areas of the field."

Tomato,Tomato spotted wilt,"Infected plants exhibit bronzing or purpling of the upper sides of young leaves and develop necrotic spots; leaf spots may resemble those caused by bacterial spot, but a bacterial ooze test will be negative; leaves may cup downwards, shoot tips may begin to die back; symptoms on ripe fruit appear as chlorotic spots and blotches, often with concentric rings; ring spot symptoms vary with different tomato cultivars; irregular ripening caused by TSWV can also show up when fruit are treated with ethylene gas; green fruit may exhibit slightly raised areas with faint concentric zonation.",Virus,"TSWV infects numerous ornamentals, vegetables, field crops and weeds; virus is vectored by at least eight species of thrips; thrips, acquires the virus during the larval stages,and transmit the virus when they are adults.",Grow available resistant varieties. Transplant only disease and whiteflies free seedlings. Remove the infected plants and burn them. Keep the field free from weeds. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and control whiteflies. If the insect infestation is severe spray suitable insecticides.
Tomato,Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl disease,"The infected leaves become reduced in size, curl upward, appear crumpled and show yellowing of veins and leaf margins. The internodes become shorter and whole plant appear stunted and bushy. The whole plant stand erect with only upright growth. The flowers may not develop and drop off.",Virus,"The virus is transmitted by white flies and may cause 100 % yield loss if the plants infect at early stage of crop. The virus also infect other hosts like common bean, ornamental plants and several weed species.",If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.
Tomato,"Aphids (Peach aphid, Potato aphid)","Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or be distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants.",Insect,Distinguishing features of aphids include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the insect's body; aphids will generally not move very quickly when disturbed; aphids may also transmit plant viruses to the plant when they feed.,Organic methods of controlling the beet armyworm include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae.
Tomato,Beet armyworm,"Singular, or closely grouped circular to irregularly shaped holes in foliage; heavy feeding by young larvae leads to skeletonized leaves; shallow, dry wounds on fruit; egg clusters of 50-150 eggs may be present on the leaves; egg clusters are covered in a whitish scale which gives the cluster a cottony or fuzzy appearance; young larvae are pale green to yellow in color while older larvae are generally darker green with a dark and light line running along the side of their body and a pink or yellow underside.",Insect,Insect can go through 3-5 generations a year.,"Control of Colorado potato beetle can be challenging as they have developed high levels of insecticide resistance; adults and larvae should be hand picked from plants and destroyed in soapy water; applications of Bacillus thuringiensis can be effective at controlling larvae but should be applied frequently; some insecticides, including spinosad, are still effective against adult beetles."
Tomato,Colorado potato beetle,Feeding damage to foliage; if infestation is severe or if left untreated plants can be completely defoliated; adult insect is a black and yellow striped beetle; larvae are bright red with black heads when they first hatch and change color to pink; larvae have two rows of black spots.,Insect,Adult beetles emerge in spring; female beetles lay eggs in batches of up to two dozen; eggs are orange-yellow and are laid on undersides of leaves; a female can lay 500 or more eggs over a four to five week period.,"Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically"
Tomato,Cutworms,"Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed  at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but are usually dirty gray or brown to black with dark spots or lines and will curl up into a characteristic C-shape when disturbed",Insect,"Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato","In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied."

Watermelon,"Aphids (Peach aphid, Melon aphid)","Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants",Insects,Distinguishing features include the presence of cornicles (tubular structures) which project backwards from the body of the aphid; will generally not move very quickly when disturbed,If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use
Watermelon,Cabbage looper,"Large or small holes in leaves; damage often extensive; caterpillars are pale green with a white lines running down either side of their body; caterpillars are easily distinguished by the way they arch their body when moving; eggs are laid singly, usually on the lower leaf surface close to the leaf margin, and are white or pale green in color",Insect,Insects overwinter as pupae in crop debris in soil; adult insect id a dark colored moth; caterpillars have a wide host range,Looper populations are usually held in check by natural enemies; if they do become problematic larvae can be hand-picked from the plants; an organically acceptable control method is the application of Bacillus thuringiensis which effectively kills younger larvae; chemical sprays may damage populations of natural enemies and should and should be selected carefully
Watermelon,Cutworms,"Stems of young transplants or seedlings may be severed  at soil line; if infection occurs later, irregular holes are eaten into the surface of fruits; larvae causing the damage are usually active at night and hide during the day in the soil at the base of the plants or in plant debris of toppled plant; larvae are 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) in length; larvae may exhibit a variety of patterns and coloration but will usually curl up into a C-shape when disturbed",Insects,"Cutworms have a wide host range and attack vegetables including asparagus, bean, cabbage and other crucifers, carrot, celery, corn, lettuce, pea, pepper, potato and tomato","Remove all plant residue from soil after harvest or at least two weeks before planting, this is especially important if the previous crop was another host such as alfalfa, beans or a leguminous cover crop; plastic or foil collars fitted around plant stems to cover the bottom 3 inches above the soil line and extending a couple of inches into the soil can prevent larvae severing plants; hand-pick larvae after dark; spread diatomaceous earth around the base of the plants (this creates a sharp barrier that will cut the insects if they try and crawl over it); apply appropriate insecticides to infested areas of garden or field if not growing organically"
Watermelon,Flea beetles,Small holes or pits in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic “shothole” appearance; young plants and seedlings are particularly susceptible; plant growth may be reduced; if damage is severe the plant may be killed; the pest responsible for the damage is a small (1.5–3.0 mm) dark colored beetle which jumps when disturbed; the beetles are often shiny in appearance,Insects,"Younger plants are more susceptible to flea beetle damage than older ones; older plants can tolerate infestation; flea beetles may overwinter on nearby weed species, in plant debris or in the soil; insects may go through a second or third generation in one year","In areas where flea beetles are a problem, floating row covers may have to be used prior to the emergence of the beetles to provide a physical barrier to protect young plants; plant seeds early to allow establishment before the beetles become a problem - mature plants are less susceptible to damage; trap crops may provide a measure of control - cruciferous plants are best; application of a thick layer of mulch may help prevent beetles reaching surface; application on diamotecoeus earth or oils such as neem oil are effective control methods for organic growers; application of insecticides containing carbaryl, spinosad, bifenthrin and permethrin can provide adequate control of beetles for up to a week but will need reapplied"
Watermelon,"Thrips (Western flower thrips, Onion thrips, etc.)",If population is high leaves may be distorted; leaves are covered in coarse stippling and may appear silvery; leaves speckled with black feces; insect is small (1.5 mm) and slender and best viewed using a hand lens; adult thrips are pale yellow to light brown and the nymphs are smaller and lighter in color,Insect,"Transmit viruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus; once acquired, the insect retains the ability to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life","Avoid planting next to onions, garlic or cereals where very large numbers of thrips can build up; use reflective mulches early in growing season to deter thrips; apply appropriate insecticide if thrips become problematic"
Wheat,Altenaria triticina (leaf blight),,,,Avoid planting seed from infected fields; avoid overhead irrigation; plant less susceptible cultivars
Wheat,Bad Image,,,,Avoid planting seed from plants grown in fields where the disease is known to be present
Wheat,Bipolaris (spot blotch),,,,Control of aphid population can provide some control of disease but is dependent on knowing which aphids are active in the field; planting to avoid periods of peak aphid activity can provide a measure of control
Wheat,Blast,,,,"Disease can be controlled by planting resistant wheat varieties, planting disease-free seed and using a seed treatment prior to planting; disease may also be avoided by planting wheat early in the Fall and by shallow seeding"
Wheat,Fusarium Head Blight,,,,Follow crop rotation with non host crops for one year. Deep summer ploughing kills sclerotia bodies present in soil. Keep the field free from grasses and other weeds. Use disease free seeds.
Wheat,Fusarium Root Rot,,,,Rotation of crop away from cereals for a period of 2-3 years will reduce levels of inoculum in the field; fungicides are commonly applied close to stem elongation to control the disease; plant resistant wheat varieties if available in your area
Wheat,Healthy,,,,Control of the disease can be difficult; durum wheat appears to be more susceptible to the disease than common wheat; crop rotation to a non-host is recommended for at least one year; applications of appropriate fungicides if available can help to control the disease in conjunction with the other measures detailed here
Wheat,Hill bunt,,,,Use good quality seeds. Provide supplemental phosphorous. Sowing when soil temperature is about 50 F increase germination and establishment. Seed treatment with suitable fungicides.
Wheat,Karnal Bunt,,,,"Planting resistant wheat varieties is one of the best ways to protect plants from powdery mildew; other control strategies include: application of appropriate foliar fungicides, if available; removal of crop debris from field after harvest to reduce the level of overwintering fungus; removal of volunteer wheat plants which can act as a reservoir for the disease"
Wheat,Leaf Rust,,,,The most effective method of controlling rusts is to plant resistant varieties of wheat; other methods of control include: destroying alternate hosts; applications of appropriate protective fungicides; growing wheat varieties that mature early
Wheat,Loose Smut,,,,Disease can be significantly reduced by rotating crops with non-hosts and tilling crop debris into soil after harvest
Wheat,Other,,,,Sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use; in commercial plantations aphid numbers are usually kept in check by predators and natural enemies; beneficial insect populations should be assessed before chemical control is considered; if no beneficial insect populations are present and aphids are damaging then apply appropriate insecticides
Wheat,Powdery Mildew,,,,Organic methods of controlling armyworms include biological control by natural enemies which parasitize the larvae and the application of Bacillus thuringiensis; there are chemicals available for commercial control but many that are available for the home garden do not provide adequate control of the larvae
Wheat,Septoria,,,,"Remove weeds around crop which may act as overwintering sites for stink bugs and practice good weed management throughout the year; organically accepted control methods include the use of insecticidal soaps, kaolin clay and preservation of natural enemies"
Wheat,Stem Rust,,,,"Chemical control impossible in a standing crop, must be applied at preplanting or as a seed treatment; if wireworms are known to be present in soil fallow field during summer and till frequently to reduce numbers; rotate to non-host crop where possible; avoid planting susceptible crops after a wireworm infestation on cereals without either fallowing of applying appropriate pesticide"
Yams,Anthracnose (Scorch),"Small, dark brown spots or black lesions on leaves which may be surrounded by a chlorotic halo; leaf necrosis; dieback of stem; withered leaves and scorched appearance",Fungus,Disease overwinters in plant debris; occurs worldwide,The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant yam varieties that are resistant to anthracnose such as TDA 291 or TDA 297
Yams,Yam mosaic disease,"The common symptoms are infected leaves show yellow and green patterns (called mosaics) between the veins or may show a narrow green strips bordering the veins (called vein banding). If the disease is severe the leaves become long, thin and strap shape (called shoe-string symptom) and whole plant become stunted. Plant may produce few small tubers with less starch content.
Some plants may recover from the virus infection soon after first symptom but virus may survive in plant and reduce the vigour.",Virus,"The virus is transmitted by aphids and tubers/setts. It may cause up to 40% loss in yield. Yam mosaic virus is always associated with yam mild mosaic virus, yam badnaviruses and cucumber mosaic virus in Africa making this disease more complex. 
Disease is reported in West Africa , South America and Caribbean.",Use healthy and disease free tubers or setts for planting. Select healthy and large tubers for planting instead of small tubers. Keep fields free from weeds. Collect crop debris and destroy them.
Yams,Dry rot disease (caused by yam nematode),"The infected tubers show dry rot of 1 to 2 cm. Initially this dry rot is of cream and light yellow lesions appear just below the outer skin without any external symptom. With progress in disease lesion spreads deeper (maximum up to 2 cm). At later stage the rot become light and dark brown to black in color and tubers may show external cracks. Entry of fungus through this wounds causes further decay of tubers in storage. 
There is no above ground symptom with yam nematode infestation.",Nematode,Some time the infected tubers may not show external cracking which make it difficult to diagnose. In that case scrap out the external layer of tuber to check the disease incidence.,"Use disease free tubers/setts for planting. Treating tubers with hot water for 40 min at 50-55 C before sowing and after harvest to reduce disease both in field and storage. In Africa smearing tubers with wood ash or cow dung shows reduced nematode infection in field. Follow crop rotation with non host or antagonist crops like ground nut, sorghum, maize, chill pepper etc."
Yams,Root Knot Nematode,The infected plants are stunted with poor growth. The leaves turn yellow in color. Tubers and feeder roots are galled. Tubers are deformed and develop abnormal rootlets. Reduction in edible portion of tubers.,Nematode,It reduces market value and quality of tubers (up to 32 - 59 % in Nigeria). The actual yield loss is estimated up to 27 to 55 %.,Deep summer ploughing to expose and kill nematode. Follow crop rotation with non host crops like groundnut and maize.
Yams,Mealybugs,Flattened oval to round disc-like insect covered in waxy substance on tree branches; insects attract ants which may also be present; insect colony may also be associated with growth of sooty mold due to fungal colonization of sugary honeydew excreted by the insect,Insect,Insects have a wide host range; often tended by ants which farm them for their sugary honeydew secretions,Prune out heavily infested branches; mealybugs can potentially be controlled by natural enemies; chemical pesticides may decrease populations of natural enemies leading to mealybug outbreaks; horticultural oils or soapy solutions can be used to treat heavy infestations
