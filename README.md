# 🌿 PlantDiseaseBot

**PlantDiseaseBot** is a web-based AI assistant designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images and assist farmers with offline, reliable, and fast diagnostics. Built with a responsive UI, modular architecture, and focused on accessibility, it ensures accurate results even in low-connectivity environments.

----------

## 🚀 Features

-   🖼 **Image-Based Diagnosis**: Upload plant leaf or fruit images for instant disease predictions.
    
-   💬 **LLM-Assisted Chat**: Get helpful responses with contextual follow-up using a custom small language model pipeline.
    
-   📚 **Offline Knowledge Base**: Uses a locally scraped dataset from [PlantVillage](https://plantvillage.psu.edu/plants) for fast, reliable lookups.
    
-   🧠 **Prevents LLM Hallucinations**: Combines fuzzy CSV lookup and relevant context injection to improve answer accuracy.
    
-   🔍 **Fuzzy Search**: Efficient fuzzy matching is used to handle spelling errors or similar-sounding plant names.
    
-   🔒 **Authentication & Session Management**: Uses Firebase Authentication, cookie-based session handling, and a temporary database for storing messages until logout.
    
-   📱 **Responsive UI**: Designed with a clean, mobile-friendly layout that works seamlessly across devices.
    
-   🌿 **Dual Model System**:
    
    -   **Fruit Disease Model**: Trained on ~87k images across 38 categories from 14 plant species.
        
    -   **Leaf Disease Model**: Trained on ~29k images with 28 classes from 14 plant species.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **CSV Lookup First**: When a user asks a plant-related question, the system first does a fuzzy match in a pre-loaded CSV database.
    
2.  **If Found**: That row's content is shown as output **and** given as context to the LLM to reduce hallucination.
    
3.  **For Follow-Ups**: Previous lookup data is used to maintain context across messages.
    
4.  **Temporary Context**: User messages are stored until logout, then cleared, ensuring privacy and efficiency.
